# Team Mortein (Clever Clubs)

A [Web Development Consulting Club (WDCC)](https://www.wdcc.co.nz/) & [Auckland University Computer Science Club (AUCS)](https://www.facebook.com/AUCSociety/) Hackathon from 8th to 9th August 2020

Awarded: **Winner for Best Teamwork**

## The Theme
Make an application to improve university experience and student wellbeing 

## The Problem
The problem we found as a team is that clubs at the University of Auckland (especially the small clubs) are hardly known and most students usually find events through recommendations. With our solution, Clever Clubs, it is easy to use and it will list all of the clubs at the University of Auckland where each club has their own club page with its contact details.

## The MVP
Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to have clubs listed and to have at least one club page displayed after clicking into one of the club listed. It is not currently deployed online. 

However, a short demo can be viewed as a YouTube link by clicking the picture below.

### Home Page
![homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41243271/90208511-1f6f9880-de3d-11ea-8345-726481cbbd52.PNG)
This is our home page where the clubs from the University of Auckland are listed in card format and separated into different categories. There is a side bar on the left for easier access to different pages. A search bar is on the top right where in the future, we can implement a filter function where the user can search to filter out the clubs they are interested in. Also, another future implementation could be an automated recommendation system where the website will track the user's recent activities on the website to suggest relevant clubs. However, the main objective is for the user to click on a card component so they can be directed to the club page where they can get details on the club.

### Club Page
![clubpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41243271/90208518-23031f80-de3d-11ea-9fd3-67e42794db05.PNG)
This is an example of a club page which contains the details (email, website, contact number) of the club. In the future, we would like to add the list of events that the club has in their own club page.

### How to Run
We have used multiple add-ins like [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/, [react-side-nav](https://reactjsexample.com/react-side-nav-component/?fbclid=IwAR0Kp29EBcSzE49h5XaMwtNltEqt4QJjZuQpLJ3gwyMhyQhJN48JnpD7Dis)

Please try "npm i" (for npm packages) and "npm chai" (for testing) on the terminal to install 

Use "npm run dev" to run our website on your local device

### Future Implementations
Due to the short timeframe for a hackathon, we were not able to implement a backend for our web application so dummy values were used. However, we would love to include this in the future and also, edit some features like add calendar, add searchbar, configure for each club, add list of events under each club page etc.

### Final Notes
At the start of this hackathon, most of our team members were not competent with web development. Therefore, all the clubs listed were dummy values and we did not incorporate a backend for our webstie. However, with the help of our mentors and by working together, we managed to create a web application where we have learnt a lot about [React](https://reactjs.org/), HTML, CSS, Javascript and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Also, we would like to give a huge shoutout to all the mentors who have helped us on the day and also, to the organisers of the event!
